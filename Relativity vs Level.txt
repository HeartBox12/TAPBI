Tutorial ideas: Two scenes which occur in sequence and lead directly into gameplay.
Scene one: Player-char is on gantry under holographic spacebar prompt. Mine is underneath and initiates lift-off.
Scene two: Player is in-air with two holo-prompts, for both left and right keys. Pressing the keys lights up the
corresponding prompt. Once both prompts are lit up, the camera slows while the ship doesn't. Ship offscreen, scene end.
